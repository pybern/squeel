            prompt: `You are an expert at classifying user questions and mapping them to business domains for SQL query assistance.

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the user's question is SQL-related (involves databases, tables, data exploration, data queries, analytics, reporting, etc.)
2. If SQL-related, identify which business domains/workspaces are most relevant
3. Classify workspaces as either "system" (predefined business areas) or "custom" (user-specific domains)

Available business domains:
- finance: Financial data, accounting, budgets, revenue, expenses
- sales: Sales performance, leads, deals, customer acquisition
- marketing: Campaigns, leads, conversion rates, marketing metrics
- hr: Employee data, payroll, performance, recruitment
- operations: Business processes, logistics, supply chain
- inventory: Stock levels, product management, warehousing
- customer-service: Support tickets, customer satisfaction, service metrics
- analytics: General data analysis, reporting, dashboards
- custom: User-specific or industry-specific domains not covered above

Guidelines:
- Mark as SQL-related if the question involves: data retrieval, database queries, reporting, analytics, data analysis, table operations
- For system workspaces: use predefined domains that clearly match the question
- For custom workspaces: when the domain is very specific to user's business or not well covered by system domains
- Provide relevance scores (0-1) for each domain
- Include confidence score for overall classification
- Be concise but clear in reasoning

Analyze this user question and classify it:\n\nUser Question: ${userMessage}`,
        });

        console.log('Intent classification result:', intent);
        return intent;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in intent classification:', error);
        // Return a default intent that's not SQL-related in case of error
        return {
            isSqlRelated: false,
            confidence: 0,
            businessDomains: [],
            reasoning: 'Error occurred during intent classification'
        };
    }
